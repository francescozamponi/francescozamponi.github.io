This research project is focused on quantum disordered and frustrated
system. The idea was to apply the methods that have been developed
in the context of classical glasses to quantum systems. The main
application are: (1) disordered bosons (e.g. disordered Helium 4),
in order to describe possible
superglass phases; (2) quantum spin glasses, mainly in connection
to quantum optimization problems.<br>

We formulated a first attempt to describe quantum glasses in
paper [32], which was selected as an "Editor Suggestion" in Phys.Rev.B and 
has been reviewed by Z.Nussinov in Physics 1, 40 (2008). 
Quoting from Nussinov's review:<br>

"Glasses are liquids that have ceased to flow on experimentally
  measurable time scales. By constrast, superfluids flow without 
  any resistance. The existence of a phase characterized by simultaneous 
  glassiness and superfluidity may seem like a clear contradiction. 
  However, in this paper, Biroli, Chamon, and Zamponi
  prove that this is not so and illustrate theoretically the possibility 
  of a superglass phase. This phase forms an intriguing amorphous 
  counterpart to the supersolid phase that has seen a surge of
  interest in recent years. Within a supersolid phase, 
  superfluidity can occur without disrupting crystalline order.

  Interacting quantum particles can indeed form such a superglass 
  phase at very low temperatures and high density, and the work of
  Biroli et al. confirms the earlier suggestion by Boninsegni, Prokofev, 
  and Svistunov and an investigation by Wu and Philips of such a
  phase. The superglass phase is characterized by an amorphous density 
  profile, yet at the same time a finite fraction of the particles 
  flow without any resistance as if they were superfluid. Thus the 
  superglass constitutes a glassy counterpart to the supersolid phase.

  The approach invoked by Biroli et al. to prove the existence of a 
  superglass is particularly elegant. It relies on mapping viscous 
  classical systems, whose properties are well known, to new many-body 
  quantum systems. In realizing the link between classical and quantum 
  systems to gain insight into the quantum many-body phases, Biroli et
  al. nicely add an important new result to earlier investigations 
  that built on such similar insights elsewhere."<br>

The main series of papers concern
the quantum cavity method. This method (in the version originally proposed by Laumann, Scardicchio and Sondhi)
has been developped by us in papers [33, 38] for spin models and bosonic models respectively.
This method is designed to treat quantum glassy phases
of models defined on Bethe lattices, that is, lattices that are locally tree-like.
We applied it to Bosonic models that display a quantum glass phase in [39], and to
several quantum optimization problems in [41,45].<br>

<p align="justify">
The fluctuation relation connects positive and negative fluctuations 
of entropy production in non-equilibrium dissipative systems. 
It can be considered as a generalization of the
second law of thermodynamics to mesoscopic length and time
scales. Also, it is a generalization of the Green-Kubo relation to
arbitrarily large driving forces. For these reasons, it attracted a lot
of interest in the last decade, since it was first proposed by
Evans, Morriss, and Cohen and proven by Gallavotti and Cohen for a
class of smooth dynamical systems.
Unfortunately, its numerical verification in realistic systems is far
from being easy, since one has to measure large deviations of the
entropy production from its average value over mesoscopic length and
time scales, and such events are very rare. For this reason, in most
cases, this relation has been tested only for small deviations (or in
other words, close to equilibrium) where, however, it reduces to the
Green-Kubo relation, or linear response theory. 
In paper [11] we were able to test this
relation, in a realistic model of a driven fluid, at a much higher
level of precision. This was made possible by combining a careful
choice of the parameters, in order to maximize nonlinear effecs, and a
detailed analysis of finite time corrections to the fluctuation
relation.
This result is important since it has been the first (and for the moment,
unique) case in which the fluctuation relation has been tested with
high accuracy beyond linear response theory in a realistic model.

In paper [35] we formulated a dynamical model of DNA mechanical unzipping under the
action of a force. The model includes the motion of the fork in the sequence-dependent
landscape, the trap acting on the bead, and the polymeric components of the
molecular construction: unzipped single strands of DNA, and linkers.<br>
Paper [44] results from a collaboration with the group of Ralf Jockers at institut Cochin.
They characterized the molecular complex of the melatonin MT1 receptor,
which directly couples to Gi proteins and the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 20.
The molecular organization of the ternary MT1/Gi/RGS20 complex was monitored in its
basal and activated state by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between probes
inserted at multiple sites of the complex. I collaborated in the elaboration of a
geometrical model of the spatial arrangement of the different proteins,
compatible with measured distances between the probes.

<p align="justify">
This research subject is based on the successful application of statistical
mechanics that have been achieved starting from the 1990s. A partial review of these
results is paper [30]. <br>
In paper [23], we studied the K-SAT problem, which is the archetype of
combinatorial optimization problems, in the limit where the ratio of
number of clauses and number of variables is large.
We showed that in this limit, if the instances are drawn uniformly at random
(random K-SAT), the problem can be solved in polynomial time (O(log(N)), where
N is the number of variables) by a simple message passing algorithm called
Warning Propagation.<br>
In paper [28] we studied the performances of a class of
stochastic heuristic search algorithms on
some random constraint satisfaction problems. We showed that, for a
large class of heuristics, the (heuristic-dependent)
largest ratio of constraints per variables for which a search algorithm is likely to find solutions
is smaller than the critical ratio above which solutions are clustered and highly correlated.

Random surfaces and quantum gravity

<!-- Relevant papers: 27<br> -->

<p align="justify">
Lorentzian Dynamical Triangulations are a particular
class of random discretized surfaces that may be relevant for quantum gravity.
In paper [27] we studied a model of
LDT in 2+1 dimensions.
We impose an additional notion of order on the 2-dimensional "spatial" slices (corresponding to a 1+1+1 structure)
that simplifies the combinatorial problem of counting geometries just enough to enable us to calculate the transfer 
matrix between boundary states labelled by the area of the spatial slices.
This is done by rewriting the partition function
of the model as the partition function of a product of random
matrices. We then solve the random matrix problem using standard
techniques such as the replica method.
In this way we can identify a critical point and investigate the continuum limit around this point, 
in particular calculating the quantum Hamiltonian of the continuum theory. 
This is the first time in dimension larger than two that a Hamiltonian has been derived from such a model by mainly 
analytical means, and might open the way for a better understanding of scaling and renormalization issues in these
models.

Propagation of light in disordered media

<p align="justify">
The aim of this study was to analytically investigate the dynamics of
the excited modes in multi-mode laser cavities, in the presence of a 
disordered amplifying medium. We developed a statistical
approach to mode-locking transitions of multi-mode laser cavities. 
We showed that, in presence of disorder,
the equations for the interacting modes can be mapped onto 
a statistical model exhibiting a spin glass transition,
with the average mode-energy playing the role of inverse temperature. 
The transition is the disordered analog of phase-locking of modes in 
standard multi-mode lasers. However, due to disorder, the locking happens
in random values of the phases ("random mode locking"), leading to 
complicated interference patterns in the emitted light. 
We also show that the mode locking is accompanied
by slow dynamics, aging, and history dependent responses, as usual in
spin glasses. The method is quite general and can be applied to other
nonlinear equations, for instance to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
describing the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates.
These predictions can therefore be tested in experiments on random
lasers and disordered cold atomic gases.

<p align="justify">
This series of papers was an attempt to use the notion of
"inherent structures", inherited from the physics of glasses,
to describe standard phase transitions of first or second order.
In particular, we tried to relate singularities in the topology
of the potential energy surface, manifested by the properties
of its minima and saddle points, to the presence of a phase
transition. Despite some interesting results on specific models,
we failed to obtain a general relation between topology and
thermodynamics.
