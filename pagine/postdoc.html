</i>

<br><br>

<b>Specific information for the 2018 call:</b>
<ul>

<li>Two post-doc positions funded by the ERC grant 'GlassUniversality' are currently open, with a preferred starting date of November 1, 2018. 
The research subject is the physics of glasses.</li>
</ul>



<b>General information:</b>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Background:</b>
several backgrounds are particularly welcome: <br>
<ol>
<li> statistical mechanics of disordered systems (glasses, spin glasses, elastic disordered systems, etc.) </li>
<li> computational physics, both for classical and quantum systems</li>
<li> out-of-equilibrium physics and large deviations </li>
<li> interdisciplinary applications of statistical physics (economy, biology, computer science, inference and statistics)</li>
<li> soft matter (jamming, granular materials, colloids, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</li><br>


<li>
<b>Host institution and scientific environment:</b>
The working place will be the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS), located at 24 Rue Lhomond in the historic center of Paris.
ENS is an ideal working place for statistical mechanics, hosting two labs (LPT and LPS) and being also surrounded by other institutions
such as ESPCI, Institut Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Institut Curie, the University of Paris 6 (UPMC Jussieu), which are all located within walking distance and host many
statistical mechanics groups.
</li><br>


<li>
<b>International collaboration:</b>
The post-docs will have the opportunity to work within 
the <a href="https://scglass.uchicago.edu" target="_blanck">"Simons Collaboration on Cracking the glass problem"</a>, 
which involves 13 senior scientists and their groups.
The collaboration will organise at least two scientific events (workshops, conferences, summer schools) 
per year where tutorials will be offered for students and post-docs. There is the possibility
of spending extended periods of time in other institutions associated to the collaboration. 
</li><br>


<li>
<b>How to apply:</b>
Applications are welcome at any time, until the positions are filled. Please send an email to myname.mysurname-at-lpt.ens.fr,
containing your CV and, if you wish, other application material such as research statement, etc.
Please use the email subject "Application YOUR_NAME YOUR_SURNAME".
Recommendation letters (at least two and no more that four) should be sent to the same address with the same subject.
Alternatively, the complete application package (including recommendation letters) can be sent through AcademicJobsOnLine
<a href="https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/edelivery/2361" target="_blanck">at this address</a>. 
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Contract and	salary:</b>
The contracts will be for two-years with possibility of extension
for a third year. The salary is estimated to 2100 euros/month (for less than 2 years experience after PhD) or 2900 euros/month (otherwise). 
The official hiring institution will be CNRS.
Funding for travel will be available, as well as large computing resources.
</li><br>

<li>
Applications from young candidates (for a first postdoc after the PhD), women, and underrepresented minorities are especially welcome.
